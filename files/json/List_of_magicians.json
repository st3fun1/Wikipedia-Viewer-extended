David also appeared on the cover of the October 2010 issue of the American magic periodical Genii (magazine), and has performed his original magic on Discovery's Grand Illusions, in England on Sky One's The Secret World of Magic, and in Japan on NHK's F.I.S.M. 2000.\nIn 2007, Acer was invited to lecture at Fechter's Finger Flicking Frolic, a close-up magic convention held in upstate New York (USA) and limited to fewer than 150 hand-picked attendees.\nHe has also performed at The Magic Castle and FISM. He has also authored several books on magic. Since 2002, he has had a regular column in Genii magazine. Acer wrote 5 episodes of the 1997-2001 series, \"Popular Mechanics for Kids\".\nAs a comedian and actor, he has had roles on the television program Mystery Hunters and in the film Levity as well as performed numerous times at Montreal's Just for Laughs festival.

He was billed as being from \"Arobia\" and possessed the Stone of Zanzabar. According to Brodien, the first time he touched Bozo (Bob Bell) with the stone, Bozo quipped \"I remember when you got stoned at the Zanzabar.\" During the mid-1970s it was rumored that Wizzo (the character, not Brodien) was a Jewish convert to Islam. Producers of the show during that time, however, denied this rumor and claimed that the storyline would have just \"confused small children\" watching the show.\nOliver O. Oliver (Ray Rayner) left Bozo's Circus in 1971 and was briefly replaced by Pat Tobin as Oliver's cousin Elrod T. Potter, and then by magician John Thompson (an acquaintance of Roy Brown's and Brodien's) as Clod Hopper. By 1973, WGN gave up on Thompson and increased Brodien's appearances as Wizzo. Brodien left the program in 1994.\nIn 1970, Brodien was the spokesperson and creator for a trick magic card deck known as TV Magic Cards, which was a renamed Svengali deck. The deck resembled a regular playing card deck, except that the cards could be shown as all the same card. Many other card tricks could be performed with the deck. Over 17 million decks of the cards were sold.\nIn the '80s Marshall Brodien would drive around the Chicago area in a Cadillac Eldorado with vanity license plates reading \"WIZ\" and custom pin-striping which contained a tiny \"WIZ\" within the striping.\nBrodien currently designs magic trick sets for children through a company called Cadaco Toys. He occasionally makes public appearances in the Chicago area and his autobiography, The Magical Life Of Marshall Brodien, was published.

Corinda did not make his birthplace public although it is believed he was born in Mill Hill, London. Born Thomas William Simpson, he took the name Tony Corinda (a variation on the name Conradi) when he began working as a mentalist in the UK. In 1950, he opened a magic studio where he sold all types of magic, but catered especially to mentalists. Later, he took over The Magic Shop in Oxford Street,London which was originally run by Dick Chavel. This store was at street level so catered mainly to the lay public, so many of the items sold were either practical jokes or beginners' tricks, but other items and small illusions for semi-professional magicians and hobbyists were also sold over the counter. Around the same period, Corinda had the magic concession in Hamleys Toy Shop in Regent Street.\nFrom 1956 to 1958, Corinda wrote a series of thirteen booklets on mentalism, each one dealing with a different aspect of mentalism or an allied art. The booklets were originally published as 13 individual 'courses'. Compiled as the encyclopedic \"Corinda's 'Thirteen Steps to Mentalism'\" the series was produced circa 1961 as a hardcover bound volume by Harry Clarke, a printer who produced many other books for magic studios at that time. Jon Tremaine and Eric Mason did much of the artwork.{ John Henley 2014 and later published in 1964 as a complete volume by D. Robbins and Co. From then the book went on to be regarded as the essential 'mentalism' reference book.\nIn 2011 Corinda's Thirteen Steps to Mentalism was republished in the Encyclopedia of Mentalism and Mentalists. http:\/\/www.mysticlightpress.com\/index.php?page_id=156 .\nThe book was later adapted into video format by mentalist and magician, Richard Osterlind.\nHis inventions are mainly from that book.\nHe lived out his retirement in Norfolk, England, and died on July 1, 2010."

He is known for his seemingly chaotic routines which, in spite of first appearances, display great skill. His original techniques and presentation style form an unorthodox and innovative contribution to sleight of hand magic.\nGreen competed at the 1988 FISM convention in The Hague, Netherlands, and was erroneously disqualified because the judges incorrectly believed he had used stooges in his act to shuffle the cards. In 1991, he performed the same act but insisted that the judges themselves shuffle the cards to prove that he used no stooges. The judges then awarded him first place.\nGreen has appeared on the fourth World's Greatest Magic television special. He lives in Gothenburg, Sweden, and lectures internationally.\nHe appeared at TED in February 2005."

He was a prolific and versatile author, publishing more than 100 books.\nGardner was best known for creating and sustaining interest in recreational mathematics\u2014and by extension, mathematics in general\u2014throughout the latter half of the 20th century, principally through his \"Mathematical Games\" columns, which appeared for twenty-five years in Scientific American, and his subsequent books collecting them.\nGardner was one of the foremost anti-pseudoscience polemicists of the 20th century. His book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, published in 1957, became a classic and seminal work of the skeptical movement. In 1976 he joined with fellow skeptics to found CSICOP, an organization promoting scientific inquiry and the use of reason in examining extraordinary claims."

He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then as \"Harry Handcuff Houdini\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.\nIn 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.\nHoudini made several movies, but quit acting when it failed to bring in money.

James Magic Show\" and his phone number are painted on virtually every street in the city. It has been estimated that there are at least 30,000 instances of his advertisement. James adopted his stage name after his grandfather, also a performing magician.\n\nChennai is a city where the wall space is tightly controlled and shared by competing political parties. It is also dominated by advertisements for commercial goods and services. Despite this, James has achieved a high penetration with his marketing campaign, at a low cost. He has, however, spent a total of 14 years painting, setting out by himself at 9:30 PM. He uses a mixture of black oxide and Fevicol for the paint, as this is cheap, but also survives through rain. James' technique has been called naive by some observers. Indeed, the advertising campaign has not resulted in particularly high market share, although James attributes this to the increasing movement of magic from the stage to the television screen.\nJames' campaign has spawned several imitators, notably A-Z entertainment, which adopts a similar font and style of placement, though at a lower concentration. It is not known what link, if any, exists between the various organizations. It is also unknown what relationship James has with the nationally famous P.C.Sorkar, or with rising local talent, such as JMK Disco Raja.\nIn late 2007, James was requested by the Commissioner of Police to abstain from his sign-painting. This is the culmination of various efforts by authorities to put an end to James' advertising campaign.\n\nIn August 2009 the magician lent his name to a book project called \u201cLooking For P James\u201d.

He was the creator of numerous original effects including his version of the color-changing silks. Another popular effect he often performed was the long-pour salt trick. Part of the act has Kaps exhibiting facial expressions of great surprise and disbelief, as he tries unsuccessfully to desperately stop the flow.\nAnother of Kaps' most renowned tricks throughout the world was the Dancing & Floating Cork, which he performed at extremely close quarters, allowing his audience to be really close-up to view the illusion.\nA small cufflink box was shown, then opened to find a wine bottle cork resting inside. With hands being held extremely steady, the cork starts to move and wriggle around inside the box. It is stated that this is a floating cork; well, all corks float on water. This one floats on air. With that, the cork floats outside the box with absolutely no visible means of support.\nA small four-inch diameter metal ring is then passed over the cork every which-way. The cork stays floating. The audience is so close they cannot see anything holding the cork afloat. At the conclusion Kaps would grab the cork and pass it to an audience member watching.\nThis was such a spectacular and successful trick that Fred Kaps then collaborated with London magician Ken Brooke at Ken Brooke's Magic Place, who then marketed the trick to magicians from the early 1970s. Before one could purchase the Kaps Dancing & Floating Cork, one would have to sign a contract with Ken Brooke NOT to reveal or share the secret with anyone, not even fellow magicians. Then one would be permitted to buy the Kaps trick.\nThe cork trick developed such a successful reputation as a close-up illusion that Michael Parkinson had Fred Kaps feature it on the British TV show Parkinson.\nFred Kaps always performed with great joy and worked very hard. He always had beads of sweat on his brow. He'd often joke about it, \"This is a magnificent building\", he said with his tenor voice, \"but I think the roof is leaking.\" This would always get a laugh, which he would milk."

He is the only magician to be in all five of the network's specials.\nIn addition to the TV specials and Harrah's performances, King performs at more than 60 private corporate events each year. Some of his better-known effects involve goldfish, Fig Newtons, and a yellow raincoat he claims is a magic cloak of invisibility.\nOne of King's most memorable moments occurred while performing his cut-and-restored rope routine. King has said that one of his biggest pet peeves is that some magicians use dull scissors, and he makes it a point to keep his scissors razor sharp. While performing the routine, he accidentally severed the tip of his thumb. He quickly tried to stop the bleeding by wrapping his thumb in tape, but the injury was too severe. He asked the audience if there was a nurse present, and a nurse stepped forward. She managed to stop the bleeding. King continued with his show and finished his second show later that evening before going to the hospital to have his injury treated.\nAfter performances, King greets show attendees as they exit, signing autographs on pictures or books. His typical autograph reads: \"I'm Mac King.\""

At one time he performed with German-born illusionist Imro Fox and Frederick Eugene Powell as The Triple Alliance. However he is best known as a performer for the long-running act he developed with his wife Talma and Leon Bosco. Working as \"Le Roy - Talma - Bosco\" they were sometimes also billed as The Comedians de Mephisto Co. Talma (whose real name was Mary Ford), specialised in sleight of hand and was known as a brilliant manipulator of coins. Bosco, who was a rotund man, played a buffoon character. Although the act was very much a partnership to which all three contributed as magicians, Servais Le Roy sometimes received additional headline billing. According to Wm Rauscher's biography, Monarch of Mystery, Bosco was played by no less than nine different performers over the years.\nServais Le Roy and Talma first performed the Asrah levitation in London in 1914. In this trick, Talma would lie on a couch and Servais would cover her with a sheet. He would then appear to make her rise into the air, pass a large hoop over her floating body, and finally pull away the sheet to reveal that she had vanished. Le Roy is also credited with developing other respected tricks and illusions, including Where do the ducks go?, Modern Cabinet, the Palanquin and the Costume Trunk.\nLe Roy later put his own show into storage and accepted a contract from Horace Goldin to front one of several companies that were touring with Goldin's show, featuring the then sensational Sawing a woman in half illusion."

He was the first American-born magician to gain fame in his own country and was African-American.\nPotter was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts;. He claimed his father was Sir Charles Henry Frankland, a tax collector for the Port of Boston and that his mother Dinah was a black servant in the household. Since Sir Charles died in England in 1768, others believe the father may have been Henry Cromwell who lived in the household or a minister by the name of George Simpson.\nRichard Potter became a well-known magician in the New England area from 1811 to his death in 1834. As a performer he obscured most of his early life and encouraged speculation. Evidently he went to Hopkinton schools. Various accounts differ on the reason but agree that he went to Europe and joined John Rannie, a Scottish ventriloquist and magician. Rannie came to the United States in 1800.\nPotter toured with Rannie as one of his assistants in the Eastern United States. In 1811 Rannie retired to Scotland and encouraged Potter to continue on his own. This is also the year that he became a Mason of African Lodge No. 459 and was part of founding the Prince Hall Masonry. Potter performed up and down the East Coast, going as far south as Alabama. One of Potter's notable run-ins with prejudice occurred in Mobile, Alabama. Despite this issue, Potter still made over $4,000 during that visit.\nIn 1814 purchased about 175 acres in the village of Andover, New Hampshire. He built a large house on his estate. This area continues to be named after him as \"Potter's Place\".\nPotter inspired Grace Metalious's character Samuel Peyton in the novel Peyton Place.\nPotter married Sally Harris in 1808. Potter claimed she was a Penobscot Native American. They had 3 children. Richard and Sally are buried in a small graveyard on the property he bought in Andover. Their graves were moved but his request was to be buried upright."

He is remembered for his innovative work in all three: in theatre, most notably Caesar (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; in radio, the legendary 1938 broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\"; and in film, Citizen Kane (1941), consistently ranked as one of the all-time greatest films.\nWelles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project in his early twenties, including an adaptation of Macbeth with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical The Cradle Will Rock. In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941. Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds performed for his radio anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air. It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety.\nHis first film was Citizen Kane (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. He struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios and later in life with a variety of independent financiers, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\".\nWelles followed up Citizen Kane with critically acclaimed films including The Magnificent Ambersons in 1942 and Touch of Evil in 1958. Although these three are his most acclaimed films, critics have argued other works of his, such as The Lady from Shanghai (1947) and Chimes at Midnight (1966), are underappreciated.\nIn 2002, Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the second most acclaimed director of all time (behind Alfred Hitchcock). Known for his baritone voice, Welles was an actor in radio and film, a Shakespearean stage actor, and a magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years."
