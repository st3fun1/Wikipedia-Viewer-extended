He was a primary developer of the Apache Web server, the most popular web server software on the Internet, and a founding member of the Apache Group, which later became the Apache Software Foundation. Behlendorf served as President of the Foundation for three years. Behlendorf has served on the board of the Mozilla Foundation since 2003 , Benetech since 2009 and the Electronic Frontier Foundation since 2013.\nBehlendorf, raised in Southern California, became interested in the early development of the Internet while he was a student at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1990s. One of his first projects was an electronic mailing list and online music resource, SFRaves, which a friend persuaded him to start in 1992. Behlendorf was an early participant and the chief technology guru for the Burning Man festival, and also founded a large online resource devoted to electronic music and related subcultures.\nIn 1993, Behlendorf, Jonathan Nelson, Matthew Nelson and Cliff Skolnick co-founded Organic, Inc., the first business dedicated to building commercial web sites. While developing the first online, for-profit, media project \u2014 the HotWired web site for Wired Magazine \u2014 in 1994, they realized that the most commonly used web server software at the time (developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) could not handle the user registration system that the company required. So, Behlendorf patched the open-source code to support HotWired's requirements.\nIt turned out that Behlendorf wasn't the only one busy patching the NCSA code at the time, so he and Cliff Skolnick put together an electronic mailing list to coordinate the work of the other programmers. By the end of February 1995, eight core contributors to the project started Apache as a fork of the NCSA codebase. Working loosely together, they eventually rewrote the entire original program as the Apache HTTP Server. In 1999, the project incorporated as the Apache Software Foundation.\nBehlendorf was the CTO of the World Economic Forum. He is also a former director and CTO of CollabNet, a company he co-founded with O'Reilly & Associates (now O'Reilly Media) in 1999 to develop tools for enabling collaborative, distributed software development. CollabNet used to be the primary corporate sponsor of the open source version control system Subversion, before it became a project of the Apache Software Foundation. He continues to be involved with electronic music community events such as Chillits, and speaks often at open source conferences worldwide.\nBehlendorf is currently Managing Director of Mithril, a global technology investment firm based in San Francisco.\nIn 2003, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.\nIn 2016 he was appointed as the Executive Director of the open source Hyperledger project at the Linux Foundation to advance blockchain technology."

Colossal Cave was written two years earlier by Will Crowther, but on a minicomputer (the PDP-10). These early text adventure games use a minimal parser, recognizing 2-word commands of the form VERB NOUN. The parser only scanned the first three letters of each command, so inputting SCREAM BEAR, SCRATCH BEAR or SCREW BEAR would be treated identically. Scott had access to an advanced 16-bit computer at home, built by his brother Richard Adams, that gave him a jump on game programming in his leisure time.\nAdams's work was very influential on the adventure-gaming industry. In 1990 Computer Gaming World reported a statement by a \"respected designer\" that it was impossible to design new and more difficult adventure puzzles, because Adams had already created them all in his early games. The games from his company, Adventure International, were subsequently released on most of the major home PC platforms of the day, including TRS-80, Apple II series, Atari 8-bit series and Commodore PET. Versions of the games were also made for later platforms such as Vic-20 and some also had versions produced with rudimentary graphics.\nSince the late 1980s Scott Adams has worked as a senior programmer for AVISTA in Platteville.\nIn 2013, Scott Adams released the Bible-based The Inheritance, his first game in over ten years. As in most of his other games, the player is the protagonist of a novel-like story, and helps events unfold in a text adventure setting. However, this new game also includes sound."

She received her bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and a master's degree in information science from the University of Chicago. She received her PhD in information science from the University of Chicago in 1973. She completed her dissertation, \"Computer-Assisted Instruction: The Application of Theorem-proving to Adaptive Response Analysis,\" while working as a research associate at Stanford University. She also served as a visiting researcher at Stanford University.\nGoldberg began working at PARC in 1973 as a laboratory and research assistant, and eventually became manager of the System Concepts Laboratory where she, Alan Kay, and others developed Smalltalk-80, which both developed the object-oriented approach of Simula 67 and introduced a programming environment of overlapping windows on graphic display screens. Not only was Smalltalk's innovative format simpler to use, it was also customizable and objects could be transferred among applications with minimal effort. Goldberg and Kay also were involved in the development of design templates, forerunners of the design patterns commonly used in software design.\nAlong with Kay, she wrote the influential article \"Personal Dynamic Media\", which predicted a world where ordinary individuals would use notebook computers to exchange, modify, and redistribute personal media. This paper outlined the vision for the Dynabook.\nShe served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) from 1984 to 1986, and, together with Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls, received the ACM Software Systems Award in 1987 and was also included in Forbes's \"Twenty Who Matter\". She also received PC Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. In 1994 she was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.\nMany of the concepts developed by Goldberg and her team at PARC became the basis for graphically based user interfaces, replacing the earlier command line based systems. According to Goldberg, Steve Jobs demanded a demonstration of the Smalltalk System, which she refused to give him. Her superiors eventually ordered her to, at which point she complied, satisfied that the decision to \"give away the kitchen sink\" to Jobs and his team was then their responsibility. Apple eventually used many of the ideas in the Alto and their implementations as the basis for their Apple Macintosh desktop environment.\nIn 1988, Goldberg left PARC to co-found ParcPlace Systems, a company that created development tools for Smalltalk-based applications. She served as ParcPlace Systems's chairwoman and CEO until its 1995 merger with Digitalk.\nShe cofounded, and is currently working at Neometron, Inc. an Internet support provider in 1999, of Palo Alto, California. She works at Bullitics. At the same time, she continues to pursue her interest in education, formulating computer science courses at community colleges in the United States and at schools abroad. In the same vein, she is a board member and adviser at Cognito Learning Media, a provider of multimedia software for science education.\nThe Computer History Museum houses a collection of Goldberg's working documents, reports, publications and videotapes related to her work on the development of Smalltalk."

Hall began writing the free replacement for the MS-DOS operating system in 1994 when he was still a physics student  at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. He remains active with FreeDOS, and is currently the coordinator for the project.\nHall has said he created FreeDOS in response to Microsoft announcing end of support for MS-DOS in 1994, a year before Windows 95 was released. As a user and fan of MS-DOS, Hall did not want the functionality of DOS to go away. Prompted by a March 31, 1994 post on comp.os.msdos.misc asking if \"anyone, for example GNU et al. ever considered writing a Public Domain DOS\", Hall decided to garner support for a free version of DOS, written under a free or public domain model. In a June 29, 1994 post, Hall announced an effort to create a free DOS, called PD-DOS, writing:\n\nA few months ago, I posted articles relating to starting a public\ndomain version of DOS. The general support for this at the time was strong, and many people agreed with the statement, \"start writing!\" So, I have...\nAnnouncing the first effort to produce a PD-DOS. I have written up a \"manifest\" describing the goals of such a project and an outline of the work, as well as a \"task list\" that shows exactly what needs to be written. I'll post those here, and let discussion follow.\nIf you are thinking about developing, or have ideas or suggestions for PD-DOS, I would appreciate direct email to me. If you just want to discuss the merits or morals of writing a PD-DOS, I'll leave that to the net. I'll check in from time to time to see how the discussion is going, and maybe contribute a little to what promises to be a very polarized debate!  :->\nI am excited about PD-DOS, and I am hoping I can get a group started!\n\nWithin a few weeks, other programmers including Pat Villani and Tim Norman joined the project. A kernel, the COMMAND.COM command line interpreter (shell) and core utilities were created by pooling code they had written or found available. Hall wrote over a dozen of the first DOS utilities for the project, mostly file and batch utilities. In a July 26, 1994 post, Hall announced the PD-DOS project had been renamed to \"Free-DOS\", having updated the project's goals to intend to distribute source code under the GNU General Public License. The project would later be renamed \"FreeDOS\", without the hyphen, after the publication of FreeDOS Kernel, by Pat Villani. Hall was the project's release coordinator from Beta1 until about Beta7, and also released the first alpha distribution of Free-DOS, as announced in a post on comp.os.msdos.misc. He is again the project coordinator since April 2011 after Pat Villani's departure.\nHall is also the original developer of GNU Robots, but he is no longer active on this project and has since handed maintainership over to Tim Northover. It is now being developed by Bradley Smith."

He is also coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. The \"K\" of K&R C and the \"K\" in AWK both stand for \"Kernighan\". Since 2000 Brian Kernighan has been a Professor at the Computer Science Department of Princeton University, where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.\nKernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the C programming language with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language (\"it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work\"). He authored many Unix programs, including ditroff.\nIn collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known heuristics for two NP-complete optimization problems: graph partitioning and the travelling salesman problem. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the Kernighan\u2013Lin algorithm, while the latter is styled Lin\u2013Kernighan.)\nKernighan was the software editor for Prentice Hall International. His \"Software Tools\" series spread the essence of \"C\/Unix thinking\" with makeovers for BASIC, FORTRAN, and Pascal, and most notably his \"Ratfor\" (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.\nHe has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.\nKernighan coined the term Unix and helped popularize Thompson's Unix philosophy. Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression \"What You See Is All You Get\" (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG). Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.\nKernighan's original 1978 implementation of Hello, World! was sold at The Algorithm Auction, the world\u2019s first auction of computer algorithms."

As an IBM employee, he wrote a program to help with a local church congregation. When demand for his program consumed too much of his time, he quit IBM and created Buttonware. He released his first program, PC-File (a flat file database), in late 1982 as \"user supported software\". He has been quoted as saying this expression not only reflected the optional payment model, but also that comments from users drove the development of later releases.\nHe collaborated with PC-Talk (communications software) developer Andrew Fluegelman to adopt similar names (PC-File was originally \"Easy-File\"), and prices, for their initial shareware offerings; they also agreed to mention each other's products in their program's documentation. Fluegelman referred to this distribution method as \"freeware\".\nA few months later (early 1983), Bob Wallace followed suit, coining the term \"shareware\" for his similarly marketed product, PC-Write, a word processor.\nAs of 2007, of the three founders of shareware, Knopf was the only one still alive, despite having a near-death experience in 1992, when his heart stopped beating briefly while experiencing a heart attack. Shortly thereafter, he sold all his business assets and retired to the Pacific Northwest. He died on October 1, 2013, after suffering for several years from heart disease and Crohn's disease."

Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.\nAda Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet George, Lord Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke (\"Annabella\"), Lady Wentworth. All Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request). Often ill, she spent most of her childhood sick. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and she became Countess of Lovelace.\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as 'the father of computers', and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.\nShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36."

As vi was a popular editor amongst programmers and system administrators, initially there was doubt whether Bram's 'improved' version could achieve the quality and fan following of the original. But since its first release for Unix systems in 1992, Vim has effectively eclipsed the original Vi, having won several awards and has been referred to as one of the most popular text editors.\nBram promotes charity and encourages people to support orphans in Uganda. He pioneered a methodology called charityware through his Vim editor. The software itself is available for free, but it encourages the user to donate to the programmer's favorite charity. A number of other applications have been licensed this way since the inception of this concept.\nOther software tools that Moolenaar has developed include a software build tool written in Python, called A-A-P, which is similar to make, and a programming language called Zimbu which puts an emphasis on readability of programs. Bram is also an assurer for the non-profit certificate authority CAcert, which means that he is eligible to verify the identities of people using the CAcert web of trust model. Amongst all of Moolenaar's contributions to the field of computer science, the Vim editor remains his most prominent and widely used application.\nMoolenaar has been a member of a Dutch Unix user group, NLUUG, which presented him with an award during its 25th anniversary, for his creation of Vim and his contributions to open source software in general.\nAs of October 2012, Moolenaar works at Google, working in the Z\u00fcrich office since July 2006. He is also the maintainer and release manager of the Vim editor."

Steele Jr. and Richard P. Gabriel (1993) name him as a leader of the Common Lisp movement and describe him as \"a seductively powerful thinker, quiet and often insulting, whose arguments are almost impossible to refute\".\nMaclisp, a variant of Lisp developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Richard Greenblatt in the late 1960s, originally ran on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers made by Digital Equipment Corporation. In the early 1970s, Moon headed a project at MIT that reimplemented Maclisp on a different kind of computer, the Honeywell 6180 running the Multics operating system. The compiler that he developed, NCOMPLR, became the \"standard against which all other Lisp compilers were measured\". As part of this project, he also wrote what became the standard manual for Maclisp more generally, titled the MacLISP Reference Manual but often called the Moonual.\nMoon was one of the original members of Greenblatt's project to develop the MIT Lisp Machine, beginning in 1974. In 1976, with Steele, he wrote the first (TECO-based) version of the Emacs text editor, and in 1978 with Daniel Weinreb he coauthored the manual for the Lisp Machine, known as the chine nual. With Howard Cannon, he developed Flavors, a system for doing object-oriented programming with multiple inheritance on the Lisp Machine. As part of the Lisp Machine project, he also invented ephemeral garbage collection, an advance that led to the widespread use of continuously-operating garbage collection systems in Lisp more generally.\nWhen Symbolics was founded in 1985 to commercialize the Lisp Machine, he became one of its founders. He continued to develop new hardware and software at Symbolics, and was listed as a Symbolics Fellow in 1989, but left the company in 1990 to join a project to develop a new operating system. He also made important contributions to the standardization of Common Lisp.\nLater, he worked for Apple Computer, where he became one of \"the primary contributors to the language design\" for the Dylan programming language."

His last name is the \"N\" in the BNF notation (Backus\u2013Naur form), used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages. He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language.\nHe began his career as an astronomer for which he received his PhD degree in 1957, but his encounter with computers led to a change of profession. From 1959 to 1969, he was employed at Regnecentralen, the Danish computing company, while at the same time giving lectures at the Niels Bohr Institute and the Technical University of Denmark. From 1969 to 1998 Naur was a professor of computer science at University of Copenhagen.\nHis main areas of inquiry were design, structure and performance of computer programs and algorithms. Areas such as software engineering and software architecture have also been pioneered by Naur. In his book Computing: A Human Activity (1992), which is a collection of his contributions to computer science, he rejected the formalist school of programming that views programming as a branch of mathematics. He did not like being associated with the Backus\u2013Naur form (attributed to him by Donald Knuth) and said that he would prefer it to be called the Backus normal form.\nNaur was married to computer scientist Christiane Floyd.\nNaur disliked the very term \"computer science\" and suggested it be called \"datalogy\" or \"data science\". The former term has been adopted in Denmark and in Sweden as datalogi, while the latter term is now used for data analysis (including statistics and databases).\nIn later years he was quite outspoken of the pursuit of science as a whole: Naur can possibly be identified with the empiricist school, that tells that one shall not seek deeper connections between things that manifest themselves in the world, but keep to the observable facts. He has attacked both certain strands of philosophy and psychology from this viewpoint. He was also developing a theory of human thinking which he called \"Synapse-State Theory of Mental Life\".\nNaur won the 2005 ACM A.M. Turing Award for his work on defining the ALGOL 60 programming language. In particular, his role as editor of the influential Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 with its pioneering use of BNF was recognized.

        "description": "Tim Paterson (born 1956) is an American computer programmer, best known for creating 86-DOS, an operating system for the Intel 8086. This system emulated the API of CP\/M, which was created by Gary Kildall. 86-DOS later formed the basis of MS-DOS, the most widely used personal computer operating system in the 1980s.\nPaterson was educated in the Seattle Public Schools, graduating from Ingraham High School in 1974. He attended the University of Washington, working as a repair technician for The Retail Computer Store in the Green Lake area of Seattle, Washington, and graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Computer Science in June 1978. He went to work for Seattle Computer Products as a designer and engineer. He designed the hardware of Microsoft's Z-80 SoftCard which had a Z80 CPU and ran the CP\/M operating system on an Apple II.\nA month later, Intel released the 8086 CPU, and Paterson went to work designing an S-100 8086 board, which went to market in November 1979. The only commercial software that existed for the board was Microsoft's Standalone Disk BASIC-86. The standard CP\/M operating system at the time was not available for this CPU and without a true operating system, sales were slow. Paterson began work on QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) in April 1980 to fill that void, copying the APIs of CP\/M from sources including the published CP\/M manual so that it would be highly compatible. QDOS was soon renamed as 86-DOS. Version 0.10 was complete by July 1980. By version 1.14 86-DOS had grown to 4,000 lines of assembly code. In December 1980 Microsoft secured the rights to market 86-DOS to other hardware manufacturers.\nWhile acknowledging that he made 86-DOS compatible with CP\/M, Paterson has maintained that the 86-DOS program was his original work and has denied allegations that he referred to CP\/M code while writing it. When a book appeared in 2004 claiming that 86-DOS was an unoriginal \"rip-off\" of CP\/M, Paterson sued the authors and publishers for defamation. The judge found that Paterson failed to 'provide any evidence regarding \"serious doubts\" about the accuracy of the Gary Kildall chapter. Instead, a careful review of the Lefer notes ... provides a research picture tellingly close to the substance of the final chapter' and the case was dismissed on the basis that the book's claims were constitutionally protected opinions and not provably false.\nPaterson left SCP in April 1981 and worked for Microsoft from May 1981 to April 1982. After a brief second stint with SCP, Paterson started his own company, Falcon Technology (aka Falcon Systems). In 1983, Microsoft contracted Paterson to port MS-DOS to the MSX computers standard they were developing with ASCII. Paterson accepted the contract to help fund his company and completed the work on the MSX-DOS operating system in 1984. Falcon Technology was bought by Microsoft in 1986 to reclaim royalty-free licenses to MS-DOS, eventually becoming part of Phoenix Technologies. Paterson did a second stint with Microsoft from 1986 to 1988, and a third stint from 1990 to 1998, during which time he worked on Visual Basic.\nAfter leaving Microsoft a third time, Paterson founded another software development company, Paterson Technology, and also made several appearances on the Comedy Central television program Battlebots. Paterson has also raced rally cars in the SCCA Pro Rally series, and even engineered his own trip computer which he integrated into the axle of a four-wheel drive Porsche 911."

He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.\nOn January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by MIT police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.\nHe committed suicide while under federal indictment for his alleged computer crimes. Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.\nIn June 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame."

Sabiston began developing software as an undergraduate and then graduate researcher in the MIT Media Lab from 1986 to 1991. While at MIT, and also after moving to Austin, Texas, in 1993, Sabiston used his 2D\/3D software to create several short films, including God's Little Monkey (1994), \"Beat Dedication\" (1988), and \"Grinning Evil Death\" (1990). \"Grinning Evil Death\" was widely seen on the first episode of MTV's \"Liquid Television\" show. \"God's Little Monkey\" won the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica award for 1994.\nIn 1997, he developed his interpolating rotoscope program, Rotoshop, for an animation contest sponsored by MTV. The software was used to produce a series of 25 30-second interstitials in New York, collectively entitled \"Project Incognito.\" He moved back to Austin in 1998 and with the help of local artists made the short film \"RoadHead.\" This was followed in 1999 by short \"Snack and Drink\" in collaboration with Tommy Pallotta. \"Snack and Drink\" won several film festival awards and resides in the MOMA video collection. The shorts collection \"Figures of Speech\" followed in late 1999, for PBS. In 2000, Sabiston hired thirty graphic artists in the Austin area to help make Richard Linklater's film Waking Life.\nAfter Waking Life Sabiston spent several years making more rotoscoped short films, including \"Yard\", \"Earthlink Sucks\", \"Grasshopper\". He directed a series of shorts for the PBS show \"Life360\". In 2003 he directed a short segment for the Lars von Trier film The Five Obstructions. Both \"Grasshopper\" and \"The Five Obstructions\" were shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004.\nIn 2004 Sabiston was hired as Head of Animation for Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly. He modified the software substantially for the film. Since 2005 he has also directed the \"Talk to Chuck\" campaign of animated advertisements for Charles Schwab.\nSabiston developed Rotoshop as a means to make rotoscoping easier for artists by automating the interpolation of hand-drawn shapes and lines over video. The software is proprietary and currently not available for use outside of Sabiston's production company, Flat Black Films.\nSabiston is also the creator of Inchworm Animation, a paint and animation program for the Nintendo DSi. It was released on April 25, 2011 in North America and subsequently in Europe, Australia, and Japan. A follow-up successor to the app, Butterfly: Inchworm Animation II was announced in October 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released the same month via the North American Nintendo eShop. A European and Japanese release is set to follow suit. The new app supports new raster and animation tools, sounds effects, and has native online sharing functions.\nSince 2008 Sabiston has developed several apps for iOS: the 3d mind-mapping app \"Headspace\", the modeling\/3d-printing app \"Voxel\", the videogame \"Retroid\", and a drawing keyboard \"Jot Keyboard\". In 2015 he released \"Lowlander\", a tribute to Richard Garriott's classic videogame \"Ultima II\"."

Later in 1981, Spencer acquired a Usenet feed from Duke University, and brought \"utzoo\" online; the earliest public archives of Usenet date from May 1981 as a result.\nThe small size of Usenet in its youthful days, and Spencer's early involvement, made him a well-recognised participant; this is commemorated in Vernor Vinge's 1992 novel A Fire Upon the Deep. The novel featured an interstellar communications medium remarkably similar to Usenet, down to the author including spurious message headers; one of the characters who appeared solely through postings to this was modeled on Spencer (and, slightly obliquely, named for him).\nHe is also credited with the claim that \"Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.\""

He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.\nStallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software. With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Debugger and the GNU Emacs text editor. In October 1985 he founded the Free Software Foundation.\nStallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.\nIn 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management, and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats and binary executables without source code.\nAs of 2016, he has received fifteen honorary doctorates and professorships (see Honors and awards)."

He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\nDuring the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.\nAfter the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment, \"gross indecency\" was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated.\" Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013."

He was one of the earliest researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing, the use of computers to analyze and process languages. He created the first program to produce random but well-formed output sentences, given a text (a children's book called Engineer Small and the Little Train). Most importantly, he showed in computer processing terms why the human brain can only process sentences of a certain kind of complexity, ones that do not exceed a \"depth limit\" (which has nothing to do with length) of the kind established independently by George Miller with his depth limit of \"seven plus or minus two\" sentence constituents in memory at any given time. Yngve was also the author of COMIT, the first string processing language (compare SNOBOL, TRAC, and Perl), which was developed on the IBM 700\/7000 series computers by Yngve and collaborators at MIT from 1957-1965. Yngve created the language for supporting computerized research in the field of linguistics, and more specifically, the area of machine translation for natural language processing."
